## Technical Details

-   **Frontend Framework**: [Angular 19](https://angular.dev)
-   **UI Components**: [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io)
-   **Application Runtime**: [Neutralino.js](https://neutralino.js.org)

### Why These Technologies?

#### Why Angular?

1. **Comprehensive API and One-Stop Solution**

    Angular provides a fully integrated solution with comprehensive APIs for routing, state management, forms handling, and dependency injection. This reduces the reliance on third-party libraries and ensures all necessary tools for developing a feature-rich application are available in one framework.

2. **Stability for Long-Term Projects**

    Angular is backed by Google and follows a predictable release schedule with long-term support (LTS). This makes it a reliable choice for projects that require stability, frequent updates, and long-term maintenance.

3. **Strong Focus on Code Organization**

    Angular enforces a highly structured approach with its modular architecture. This makes it easier to scale, debug, and maintain complex projects like BotBrowserConsole, where features such as profile management and API integrations are tightly coupled.

4. **Robust Ecosystem for Enterprise Development**

    With extensive documentation, a large community, and built-in TypeScript support, Angular is designed for large-scale applications. It is particularly well-suited for managing high-performance requirements while maintaining code quality and stability.

#### Why Neutralino.js?

1. **Lightweight and Efficient**

    Neutralino.js leverages the native WebView of the operating system, drastically reducing the application size compared to Electron, which bundles Chromium and Node.js. This lightweight approach ensures the application runs smoothly without overloading system resources.

2. **Optimized for Resource-Intensive Applications**

    BotBrowserConsole requires running multiple isolated browser instances, and Neutralino.js minimizes memory and CPU usage, making it ideal for this use case.

3. **Simplified Maintenance**

    Neutralino.js relies on system-level components rather than bundling its own runtime. This simplifies dependency management, reduces compatibility issues, and ensures the application works seamlessly across different platforms.

4. **Quick Development and Deployment**

    Its straightforward architecture allows for faster development and easier deployment, perfect for tools like BotBrowserConsole that need to be distributed and updated frequently.
